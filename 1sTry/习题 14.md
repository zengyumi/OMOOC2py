### 2.Change the prompt variable to something else entirely.

### 3.Add another argument and use it in your script, the same way you did in the previous exercise with first, second = ARGV.

2和3的练习一起做了：

### 4.Make sure you understand how I combined a """ style multiline string with the % format activator as the last print.
